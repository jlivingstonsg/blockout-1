# BlockOut for browser in JavaScript and HTML5  
=======

This is a remake of the 3D Tetris "BlockOut" from 1989. <br>
I didn't write it, I just made a few modifications.  
The original lives on [Chrome Experiments](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/cubeout/?f=) and was done by [alteredq](https://github.com/alteredq).

Animation can get a little jaggy occasionally, but everything behaves as it should. <br>

I will try to make it look and work, as the original BlockOut from 1989.  <br>
